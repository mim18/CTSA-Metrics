-- Query Informatics Metrics CTSA EDW
-- Data Model: ACT i2b2/SHRINE Ontology V1.0
-- Database: Oracle
-- Updated: 1/17/18 Michele Morris (Pitt DBMI) Adapted from 'Informatics Metric PCORnet Oracle.sql' 
-- Total patient count is from Patient_Dimension
-- Version 1.0 of ACT ontology only includes ICD9 Procedures
-- Replace schema name (NCATS2I2B2DEMODATA ) with your i2b2 demodata schema name
